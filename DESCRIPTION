Title: Match One Sample using Two Criteria
Version: 1.1.0
Authors@R: person("Bo", "Zhang", email = "bozhan@wharton.upenn.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Multivariate matching in observational studies typically has two goals: 1. to construct 
    treated and control groups that have similar distribution of observed covariates and 2. to produce 
    matched pairs or sets that are homogeneous in a few priority variables. This packages implements a
    network-flow-based method built around a tripartite graph that can simultaneously achieve both goals.
    A detailed explanation of the workflow and numerous examples are given in the vignette.
