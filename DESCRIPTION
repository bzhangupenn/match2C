Title: Match One Sample using Two Criteria
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bo Zhang
Maintainer: Bo Zhang <bozhan@wharton.upenn.edu>
Description: Multivariate matching in observational studies typically has two goals: 1. to construct 
    treated and control groups that have similar distribution of observed covariates and 2. to produce 
    matched pairs or sets that are homogeneous in a few priority variables. This packages implements a
    network-based method built around a tripartite graph that can simultaneously achieve both goals. A
