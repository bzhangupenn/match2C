Title: Match One Sample using Two Criteria
Version: 1.2.2
Authors@R: person("Bo", "Zhang", email = "bozhan@wharton.upenn.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Multivariate matching in observational studies typically has two goals: 1. to construct 
    treated and control groups that have similar distribution of observed covariates and 2. to produce 
    matched pairs or sets that are homogeneous in a few priority variables. This packages implements a
    network-flow-based method built around a tripartite graph that can simultaneously achieve both goals.
    A detailed explanation of the workflow and numerous examples are given in the vignette. The 'optmatch' 
    package, which is useful for running many functionalities, can be downloaded at 
    <https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch>.
